An **external automation tool** (patcher) that adds **Lua scripting support** to the **[Arizona/Rodina](https://arzgame.online/)** client through the external **[NeoMLoader](https://t.me/neomloader)** library.

This repository contains a build pipeline that dynamically patches the game. It is responsible for:
- 📥 Downloading the official client and decompiling it locally
- 🧩 Automatically unpacking NeoMLoader resource files
- 🗒️ Automatically installing default Lua scripts & libs
- 🔄 Checking if the launcher version is up to date
- 💰 Managing Unity Ads behavior *(to support the continued development of this tool)*

It is strictly a build automation tool (a patcher) that modifies the official client locally via CI/CD pipelines.

## 📥 Installation (For Players)

If you only want to play, you don't need to build the project yourself. 

Our automated CI/CD pipeline builds the latest version every time the game updates.

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MTGMODS/arz_monetloader/releases/latest).
2. Download the latest `arizona` or `rodina` apk.
3. Install the APK on your Android device and grant the necessary permissions.
4. Use the `/mtg` command in-game to manage your scripts!

# 🚀 Build Process (Local Development)

If you want to compile the project yourself:

### 1️⃣ Requirements
- **Python 3.10+** (requires requests and python-dotenv modules)
- **Java 8+** (for dynamic compilation and apktool)
- **Keystore for signing the final APK** *(if not provided — unsigned apk will be saved)*
---
### 2️⃣ Build Steps

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MTGMODS/arz_monetloader.git
cd arz_monetloader
```
2. Install **Python** dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set **your keystore** credentials in the **.env** file located in the project root

```bash
KEY_ALIAS="alias"
KEY_PASS="key_password"
KEYSTORE_PASS="keystore_password" # optional if same as KEY_PASS
```

4. Run the orchestrator script in the terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
The script will sequentially launch isolated subprocesses for each target defined in main.py (e.g., Arizona, then Rodina). 

For each target, it will automatically download the original APK, decompile it, inject the Smali code, auto-adapt Java paths, build the project, and sign the final APK.

Tip: If you want to build only a specific target, you can run the builder directly:
```bash
python build_launcher.py arizona
# or
python build_launcher.py rodina
```
